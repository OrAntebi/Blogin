# 🎨 Blogin Landing Page — Pixel Perfect Project

This project is part of my web development studies, focusing specifically on **Pixel Perfect implementation** according to a given Figma design.

The goal was to accurately reproduce the layout, spacing, typography, and overall look & feel using only **HTML** and **CSS**, while ensuring full **Responsive Design**.
